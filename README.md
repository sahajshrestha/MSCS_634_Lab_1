# MSCS_634_Lab_1# Lab 1: Data Exploration, Visualization, and Preprocessing

## Purpose
To apply foundational data science techniques such as data visualization, cleaning, and statistical analysis using a real-world dataset.

## Key Insights From Visualization and Statistical Measures
- Weekly sales are influenced by unemployement.
- Not conclusive, but it seems like if the temperature is lower than 20F, the fuel price drops as well. 
- Line plots reveal periodic spikes likely due to holidays.
- Detected and removed outliers to improve analysis accuracy.

## Challenges
- Setting up the environment for Jupyter Notebook. Installation and dependency issues. 
- Deciding which columns were less relevant for reduction.
